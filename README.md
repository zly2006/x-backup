## Usage

### Creating a Backup

You can use the `/xb create` command to create a new backup. This command saves the current state of the game so you can restore it later. If you want to add a note to the backup, you can add it after the command, for example:

```
/xb create This is my first backup
```

This way, you create a backup with a note.

### Viewing Created Backups

If you want to view the backups you have created, you can use the `/xb list` command. This command lists all the backups and displays the number, creation time, and note of each backup. For example:

```
/xb list
```

This command displays the last 6 backups. If you have many backups, you can click the gray font button to view more backups.

### Restoring a Backup

If you want to restore to a specific backup, you can use the `/xb restore <id>` command, where `<id>` is the number of the backup. For example:

```
/xb restore 1
```

This command restores the game to the state of backup number 1. If you want to restore a specific range, you can use the `--chunk` parameter to specify the coordinates from which to which, for example:

```
/xb restore 1 --chunk 0 0 10 10
```

> [!TIP]
> These are the x/z coordinates of the blocks, do not confuse them with chunk coordinates.

This will restore the game to backup 1, but only restore the area from block coordinates (0, 0) to (10, 10).
### Scheduled Backup Configuration

You can set the automatic backup interval using the `/xb backup-interval <seconds>` command. For example, if you want to automatically back up every 3 hours, you can set it like this:

```
/xb backup-interval 10800
```

This command sets the automatic backup interval to 10,800 seconds (i.e., 3 hours).

### Mirror Server Configuration

If you are using a mirror server, you can use the `/mirror` command to synchronize the latest backup from the main server. For example:

First, you need to create a backup on the main server:

```
/xb create
```

Then, in the mirror server configuration, set the main server's file path (the one containing `server.properties`) and `blob_path`, and enable mirror mode:

```json
{
  "mirror_mode": true,   
  "mirror_from": "C:\\MinecraftServer\\My-Server",
  "blob_path": "C:\\MinecraftServer\\My-Server\\blob"
}
```

After that, execute the `/mirror` command. This command will synchronize the latest backup state from the main server to the mirror server. You can also add the `id` parameter to specify the backup number to synchronize:

```
/mirror 1
```

If you want to stop the server and restore the backup, you can use the `--stop` parameter:

```
/mirror --stop
```

### Cleaning Up Unnecessary Backups

The mod also provides an automatic cleanup feature for old backups. You can set the `keep_policy` in the configuration file, for example:

```json
{
  "prune": {
    "enabled": false,
    "keep_policy": {
      "1d": "30m",
      "1w": "6h",
      "1M": "1d",
      "1y": "1w",
      "2y": "1M"
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration means:
- Keep backups every 30 minutes for the last 1 day
- Keep backups every 6 hours for the last 1 week
- Keep daily backups for the last 1 month
- Keep weekly backups for the last 1 year
- Keep monthly backups for the last 2 years

You can adjust these settings according to your needs.

When `enabled` is `true`, the mod will automatically clean up backups that do not meet the retention policy. Alternatively, you can manually clean up unnecessary backups using the `/xb prune` command.

### Viewing Backup Information

If you want to view detailed information about a specific backup, you can use the `/xb info <id>` command, for example:

```
/xb info 1
```

This command will display detailed information about backup #1, including backup time, notes, size, etc.
